# 🤖 ML Survival Cheatsheets

> Curated, no-fluff collection. From probability and stats to neural networks and model deployment.

## 🎯 Why This Exists

ML is *a lot*.

One moment you're tuning hyperparameters, the next you're trying to remember how Bayes' Theorem works, and suddenly you're debugging matrix shapes like it’s a full-time job.

This repo is your survival kit — a **modular, high-signal set of guides** for learners, builders, and career-switchers who want to *understand* what they're doing (not just run `.fit()` and pray).

Whether you’re prepping for interviews, building your first model, or brushing up on forgotten theory — **this is for you**.

## 🧠 What's Inside

Each section is a standalone markdown file you can read in <10 minutes.

| Area | Cheatsheet |
|------|------------|
| 📊 **Probability & Stats** | `cheatsheets/probability.md`  / `statistics.md` |
| 🧮 **Linear Algebra for ML** | `cheatsheets/linear-algebra.md` |
| 🧠 **Core ML Algorithms** | `cheatsheets/ml-algorithms.md` |
| 🔧 **Optimization & Loss** | `cheatsheets/optimization.md` |
| 🤖 **Deep Learning** | `cheatsheets/deep-learning.md` |
| 🧪 **Evaluation & Metrics** | `cheatsheets/evaluation.md` |
| 🧹 **Data Preprocessing** | `cheatsheets/data-preprocessing.md` |
| 🧯 **Model Interpretability** | `cheatsheets/interpretability.md` |
| 🏗️ **Production ML** | `cheatsheets/production-ml.md` |
| 💼 **Interview Review** | `cheatsheets/interview.md` (high-yield review) |

> Each cheatsheet is beginner-friendly but designed to scale up with you. Simple when you need it, deeper when you want it.

## ✨ Acknowledgments

Built with frustration, caffeine, and compassion for every student who googled *“what’s a p-value again?”* five minutes before a take-home test.

> This stuff is hard. It is PhD level shit. You are doing great.
