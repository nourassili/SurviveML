# ML Survival Cheatsheets

> Curated, no-fluff collection. From probability and stats to neural networks and model deployment.

##  Why This Exists

ML is *a lot*.

One moment you're tuning hyperparameters, the next you're trying to remember how Bayes' Theorem works, and suddenly you're debugging matrix shapes like it’s a full-time job.

This repo is your survival kit — a **modular, high-signal set of guides** for learners, builders, and career-switchers who want to *understand* what they're doing (not just run `.fit()` and pray).

Whether you’re prepping for interviews, building your first model, or brushing up on forgotten theory — **this is for you**.

## What's Inside

Each section is a standalone markdown file you can read in <10 minutes.

| Area | Cheatsheet |
|------|------------|
|  **Probability & Stats** | `cheatsheets/probability.md`  / `statistics.md` |
|  **Linear Algebra for ML** | `cheatsheets/linear-algebra.md` |
|  **Core ML Algorithms** | `cheatsheets/ml-algorithms.md` |
|  **Optimization & Loss** | `cheatsheets/optimization.md` |
|  **Deep Learning** | `cheatsheets/deep-learning.md` |
|  **Evaluation & Metrics** | `cheatsheets/evaluation.md` |
|  **Data Preprocessing** | `cheatsheets/data-preprocessing.md` |
|  **Model Interpretability** | `cheatsheets/interpretability.md` |
|  **Production ML** | `cheatsheets/production-ml.md` |
|  **Interview Review** | `cheatsheets/interview.md` (high-yield review) |

> Each cheatsheet is beginner-friendly but designed to scale up with you. Simple when you need it, deeper when you want it.

## How to Use This Repo

- Open the folder [`cheatsheets/`](./cheatsheets/) and dive into any topic  
- Use the [Interview Cheatsheet](./cheatsheets/interview.md) for job prep  
- Share this repo with friends who are lost in their ML class or bootcamp  
- Clone and keep this next to your notebooks or side projects  
- Use it to **fill gaps**, **refresh**, or **clarify concepts** fast

##  Roadmap

- [ ] Visuals and diagrams for common concepts  
- [ ] Flashcard-style quizzes (Markdown + Anki)  
- [ ] PDF version (clean print layout)  
- [ ] Jupyter + Python snippets per sheet  
- [ ] GitHub Pages site via Quarto

## Contribute

Pull requests welcome!

If you:
- Have a clearer explanation
- Want to add a new topic (e.g., Bayesian stats, time series)
- Found a typo or want better examples

...please fork and submit! Let’s build the ML resource we all wish we had.

## ✨ Acknowledgments

Built with frustration, caffeine, and compassion for every student who googled *“what’s a p-value again?”* five minutes before a take-home test.

> This stuff is hard. It is PhD level shit. You are doing great.
