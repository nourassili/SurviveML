# ML Survival Cheatsheets

> From probability and stats to neural networks and model deployment.

##  Why This Exists

ML is *a lot*.

One moment you're tuning hyperparameters, the next you're trying to remember how Bayes' Theorem works, and suddenly you're debugging matrix shapes.

This repo is your survival kit if you want to *understand* what you're doing (not just run `.fit()` and pray).

Whether you’re prepping for interviews, building your first model, or brushing up on forgotten theory... **this is for you**.

## What's Inside

Each section is a standalone markdown file you can read in <10 minutes.

| Area | Cheatsheet |
|------|------------|
|  **Probability & Stats** | `cheatsheets/probability.md`  / `statistics.md` |
|  **Linear Algebra for ML** | `cheatsheets/linear-algebra.md` |
|  **Core ML Algorithms** | `cheatsheets/ml-algorithms.md` |
|  **Optimization & Loss** | `cheatsheets/optimization.md` |
|  **Deep Learning** | `cheatsheets/deep-learning.md` |
|  **Evaluation & Metrics** | `cheatsheets/evaluation.md` |
|  **Data Preprocessing** | `cheatsheets/data-preprocessing.md` |
|  **Model Interpretability** | `cheatsheets/interpretability.md` |
|  **Production ML** | `cheatsheets/production-ml.md` |
|  **Interview Review** | `cheatsheets/interview.md` (high-yield review) |

> Each cheatsheet is beginner-friendly but designed to scale up with you. Simple when you need it, deeper when you want it.
